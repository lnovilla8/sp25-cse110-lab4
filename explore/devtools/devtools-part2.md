1. What was the bug?
num1 and num2 were set as strings so they were not able to be added together properly.

2. How would you fix it? Include a screenshot of your fix. Name it fix.png (or whatever image extension you would like to use) and add it to your expand/screenshots directory.
Typecast num1 and num2 to floats before they get added.
